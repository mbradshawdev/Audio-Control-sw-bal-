# Audio-Control-sw-bal-
AHK script for switching audio devices, adjusting multi-channel balance and some other things in Win7/10.
  
Currently only using/maintaining:  
'sw'itch: Find and set the desired device as default.  
  
Probably Still work:  
'bal'   : To enter in a set of values corresponding to the speaker channels, this pretty soon evolved into just hard-coding pre-defined settings such as bal51 for adding some volume to the rear speakers, keeping the always-too-loud sub low etc.  
  bal51, annoy, stereo, manual, default are all recognised commands for this ..useage of the script  
'shift' : Adds or subtracts a specified amount from a specified channel (or two for front and rear)  
  up, down / front, rear, left, right, back left, back right, center, sub are included ('Shift front up 10' or 'shift rear down 23')  
'set'   : As above but shifts a channel or pair of channels to a specific value ('set center 0' or 'set sub 99' etc)  
  
No longer care about:  
'fill'  : Toggles the enhancement 'speaker fill' programs don't seem to like changes to Enhancements, even MPC needs a currently playing track to be stopped and restarted  
'loud'  : As above but for another windows audio enhancement "Loudness Equalization" suffer the quiet voices and loud effects of movies no more!   


Posting here to demonstrate my improving coding ability (pls give me a job) and to keep active on here.  
And if anyone actually reads this: Any feedback/improvements/suggestions/employment welcome! Thanks!
